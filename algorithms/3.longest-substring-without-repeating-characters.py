# Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
#
# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate
# characters.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and
# "cab" are also correct answers.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a
# substring.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
# s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
#

            max_len = max(max_len, i - start + 1)
        
        return max_len
        
        # One-liner alternative (less readable but works):
        # return max(((lambda start, chars, i: i - start + 1)(next((i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c == s[j] and i != j), j), {c for c in s[:j]}, j) for j in range(len(s))), default=0)
